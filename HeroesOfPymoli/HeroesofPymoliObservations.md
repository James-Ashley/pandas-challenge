PANDAS CHALLENGE OBSERVATIONS:

1. The percentage of male players versus female players is a very considerable one. If you take this data and combine it with the fact that the few females that do play spend more money for in-game items. This would lead me to start a project of market analysis to make the game more marketable to female gamers.

2. The players' age range of early to mid 20's, (20-24,) not only make the most purchases but, also account for the majority of the game's population.

3. "Final Critic" and "Oathbreaker, Last hope of the Breaking Storm" are the top two items concerning popularity and profitability. This would make me want to analyze the game mechanics behind these two items being as such. Then a plan could be implemented to mirror this in other items to increase profits. This should be done while keeping the integrity of the game mechanics.
